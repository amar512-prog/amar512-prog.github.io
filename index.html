          <h1 id="api">API And Its Standard Creation (with Postman)</h1>
          <h2 id="what-is-api">What is API?</h2>
          <p>Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, provide a way for different pieces of code (or a human and code) to
            interact with one another. In context of web, the term API has become more specific and is now primarily used to
            refer to web APIs. A web API is an interface between a client and a server, where the client sends requests and the
            server responds to them.</p>
          <h2 id="types-of-api-call">Types of API call</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Safe - A safe request doesn't modify data on the server.</li>
            <li>Idempotent - A request that returns same result no matter how many times it is called. It modifies the server
              only in first call and doesn't make changes in subsequent call.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="structure-of-api-request">Structure of API Request</h2>
          <p>Every API request needs an endpoint and an action. In the web API, endpoint is basically an URL because API
            endpoint specifies the resource that server is going to interact. Note: If web API endpoint start with / instead of http or
            www, it means base API url is left out. API actions, also known as verbs, are used to specify the desired action
            to be taken with a specified resource in an API call using endpoint. Different resources may have different valid API
            actions, and some actions are more specialized for particular applications. The most commonly used API actions are
            GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These actions are sometimes referred to as CRUD, which stands for Create, Read,
            Update, and Delete.</p>
          <p>When to use it is important to use the correct action when interacting with an API to ensure that the desired
            action
            is taken. The POST action is used to create new objects in an API, the GET action is used to read information
            about
            existing objects, the PUT action is used to modify existing objects, and the DELETE action is used to delete
            objects.
            Having an API that supports all aspects of CRUD gives a lot of flexibility and it is why these four actions are
            the
            most common ones that you will see. PATCH, OPTIONS, and HEAD are also used in APIs and their usage is similar to
            the
            four main actions, but are rarely used.</p>
      
          <h2 id="api-parameters">API Parameters</h2>
          <p>API parameters are used to create standard structure in an API. They allow similar things to be grouped together
            and
            make it easier to retrieve specific information.</p>
          <h3 id="request-parameters">Request Parameters</h3>
          <p>Example: <code>GET https://api.github.com/users/:{username}/repos</code></p>
          <p>Above example is the API call for getting the repositories for a particular user in GitHub. The username
            parameter in
            the API endpoint is known as a request parameter. These parameters act as replaceable strings in the API endpoint
            and
            are common in web APIs. They can also be represented using curly braces instead of a colon. The purpose of request
            parameters in the example is replacing the username in the API endpoint to retrieve the repositories of different
            users.</p>
          <h3 id="query-parameters">Query parameters</h3>
          <p>These parameters act as a filter or additional action that can be applied to an endpoint. They are represented by
            a
            question mark in the API endpoint and are specified with a key, which is the item being queried for, and a value,
            which is what the query should return.</p>
          <p>Example: <code>GET https://api.github.com/user/repos?type=member</code>
          <p>This example shows repos that I am member of.</p>
          <h2 id="api-header">API Header</h2>
          <p>Every API request includes headers that provide background information about the client sending the request.</p>
          <h2 id="api-body">API Body</h2>
          <p>Every API request includes body that provide attribute of the resources. Generally, POST and PUT requires the
            body
            and it can be form-data, encoded form data, raw data, binary data, and even GraphQL data.</p>
          <h2 id="api-response">API Response</h2>
          <p>It is sent by server after processes the client information. Response includes body, cookies and headers.</p>
          <h2 id="types-of-api">Types of API</h2>
          <p>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol that is used to exchange structured data between
            applications over a network. It is an XML-based protocol and requires more overhead than RESTful APIs. It was
            developed for corporate use cases and has strict rules in place for how the two sides of the interface can
            interact
            with each other.</p>
          <p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is a web architecture and an approach to communications that is often used
            in
            the development of web services. It is a client-server protocol that is lightweight and simple, making it easier
            to
            develop and maintain than SOAP-based APIs.</p>

             <ul>
               <li>use addition in case of multiplication if possible</li>
               <li>To count the number of 1s in an input: int __builtin_popcount (unsigned int x)</li>
                <li>Be careful about duplicate (repeat same expression) computation</li>
